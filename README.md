# PRASUNET_CS_01
+This project implements a simple Ceaser Cipher encryption and decryption tool. Caesar Cipher, a cryptographic technique used to encrypt and decrypt messages. 
Plain text is encrypted using this encryption method so that only the intended recipient can decipher it.
+
+
+Features:
+
1. Encrypt plaintext messages using a specified key (shift).
2. Decrypt ciphertexxt messages using the same key used for encryption.
3. Supports both uppercasae and lowercase letters, preserving non alphabetic characters.
